# PAC stands for Perception Action Cycle. An APM is a single action by the user. 

One PAC is defined as a shift of the screen to a new location for some time followed by at least one action then shift to another location. The delay to the first action in a PAC turns out to be one of the best predictors across all leagues, and the best in certain leagues (beating out the venerable APM, which, despite itâ€™s faults, is a good predictor of league).
