# Introduction

StarCraft 2 is a sequel to the ever popular real time strategy game, StarCraft Brood War. In its competitive form, two players face each other on various maps choosing one of three available races or a random choice. The database used can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/sfu-summit/starcraft-ii-replay-analysis and the original study of this dataset is at http://summit.sfu.ca/item/13328

I am exploring this dataset to look mehanical differences among players of different skill levels. The skill levels are broadly placed into bins from 1 to 8, 8 being the most skilled and smallest percentage of the sample. 

Each variable in the dataset is hypothesized to be correlated with higher skill. For instance, better players will make and be able to use more complex units. Lower level players generally play with lower APM and utilize less mechanical tools available (hot keys and mini map functions). Most variables are divided by the time elapsed to generate a standard for variables that naturally acculumate over time. 

This data is also a snapshot of the overall skill levels for players at the time of data collection and for the specific expansion called Wings of Liberty. The explanation of league placement is shown here: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Battle.net_Leagues

My main question is which variables affect skill level most? Other questions include what habits separates players in top placements? This can provide insight into where players at each skill level hit skill walls and must work deliberately in order to improve and move into higher league placements.

# Univariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: In this section, you should perform some preliminary exploration of
your dataset. Run some summaries of the data and create univariate plots to
understand the structure of the individual variables in your dataset. Don't
forget to add a comment after each plot or closely-related group of plots!
There should be multiple code chunks and text sections; the first one below is
just to help you get started.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
summary(sc)

ggplot(aes(LeagueIndex), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram()
table(sc$LeagueIndex)

ggplot(aes(Age), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,50,5))
summary(sc$Age)
table(sc$Age)
```
These are counts of the contributing players to this dataset. Technically, professional and grandmaster players are both in the grandmaster category, but the community agrees pro players are in a different class.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Time_data}
ggplot(aes(HoursPerWeek), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(HoursPerWeek), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

ggplot(aes(HoursPerWeek), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50), breaks = seq(0, 50, 5))

summary(sc$HoursPerWeek)

ggplot(aes(HoursPerWeek), 
       data = subset(sc, sc$HoursPerWeek < 112)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

summary(subset(sc$HoursPerWeek, sc$HoursPerWeek < 112))

ggplot(aes(TotalHours), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram()

summary(sc$TotalHours)

ggplot(aes(TotalHours), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) + 
  xlim(0, 1500)

summary(subset(sc$TotalHours, sc$TotalHours < 15000))
```
The hours spent playing StarCraft 2 is left skewed with many outliers. Zooming into hour per week, we can see most players play between 0 to 35 hours a week. Zooming into total hours, most players are in the 0 to 1500 hours categories. The higher end of the total hours played is just impossible, so I subsetted the data in the final summary. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_APM}
ggplot(aes(APM), data = sc) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

ggplot(aes(APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 220))

summary(sc$APM)
```
The majority of APM values are somewhere between 50 and 200. Zooming in, we get a clearer view of that most players do play within the 80 and 150 APM range. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_general}
ggplot(aes(GapBetweenPACs), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

ggplot(aes(GapBetweenPACs), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 150))

summary(sc$GapBetweenPACs)

ggplot(aes(TotalMapExplored), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .00001)

summary(sc$TotalMapExplored)

ggplot(aes(WorkersMade), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.0001)

summary(sc$WorkersMade)
```
These are general, singular measurements of different skill levels. Of course, these are all naturally correlated with APM, so it makes sense that the distributions are similar to the APM histogram. Since these are all standardized based on a time period, it also makes sense that they have similar distributions based on this normalization. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Workers_created_raw}
sc$WorkersCreatedTotal <- sc$WorkersMade * sc$MaxTimeStamp
sc$WorkersCreatedTotal <- round(sc$WorkersCreated)
summary(sc$WorkersCreatedTotal)
```


> **Tip**: Make sure that you leave a blank line between the start / end of
each code block and the end / start of your Markdown text so that it is
formatted nicely in the knitted text. Note as well that text on consecutive
lines is treated as a single space. Make sure you have a blank line between
your paragraphs so that they too are formatted for easy readability.

# Univariate Analysis

> **Tip**: Now that you've completed your univariate explorations, it's time to
reflect on and summarize what you've found. Use the questions below to help you
gather your observations and add your own if you have other thoughts!

### What is the structure of your dataset?

There are 3395 contributing players to this dataset with one general skill categorization (LeagueIndex), player information (Age, HoursPerWeek, TotalHours), and general measurements of skill. 

LeagueIndex goes from 1 to 8. 1 being the worst and 8 being you should go compete in tournaments.

Observations:
* Most contributing users are in the top half of the player pool according to the league placement distribution.
* Mean APM among these players is 117.05 which is a little low from my expectations
* All the variables that have been divided by time are very similarly distributed.
* The max value in TotalHours is 1000000 hours which is definitely an error because that is physically impossible. The game was released in July 2010, and the data was collected in 2013. This is probably just some people being funny.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

I'd like to primarily see which measure or collection of measurements characterize skill best. I suspect all PAC data is the most telling and GapBetweenPACs to be the difference before players achieve GrandMaster or higher placement. Secondarily, I'd like to explore the relationship with time spent playing to help debunk the idea that ability in StarCraft 2 is fixed. 

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \ 
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

I'm guessing hot key usage is the next best predictor of skill. Habitually using your hot keys allows a player to play the game more fluidly, faster, and manage various aspects of the game simultaenously. Neglecting hot keys, particularly the SelectByHotkeys significantly hinders overall gameplay.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

I created a total workers made variable by multiplying WorkersMade and MaxTimeStamp. Since there is no such thing as a fraction of a worker, I used the round() function to make everything integers instead.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?

I subsetted TotalHours and HoursPerWeek variables to eliminate the impossible values such as playing for 100000 when the game has not been released for that long. I subsetted HoursPerWeek to values less than 112 hours because there are only 168 hours in a week, and I'm assuming a third of those hours are spent sleeping or doing other things besides playing StarCraft 2. 

Just looking through the data, players with LeagueIndex 8, the professional players, don't have data for age or time. 

# Bivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what relationships
between variables might be interesting to look at in this section? Don't limit
yourself to relationships between a main output feature and one of the
supporting variables. Try to look at relationships between supporting variables
as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, new_variables}
sc_wo_na <- subset(sc, !is.na(Age) & !is.na(HoursPerWeek) & !is.na(TotalHours))
sc_wo_na$ComplexUnitsMadeTot <- sc_wo_na$ComplexUnitsMade * sc_wo_na$MaxTimeStamp
sc_wo_na$ComplexAbilityUsed <- round(sc_wo_na$ComplexUnitsMadeTot)
sc_wo_na$UniqueHotkeysTot <- sc_wo_na$UniqueHotkeys * sc_wo_na$MaxTimeStamp
sc_wo_na$WorkersCreatedTotal <- sc_wo_na$WorkersMade * sc_wo_na$MaxTimeStamp
sc_wo_na$WorkersCreatedTotal <- round(sc_wo_na$WorkersCreated)
sc$UniqueHotkeysTot <- sc$UniqueHotkeys * sc$MaxTimeStamp

sc$ComplexUnitsMadeTot <- sc$ComplexUnitsMade * sc$MaxTimeStamp
sc$ComplexUnitsMadeTot <- round(sc$ComplexUnitsMadeTot)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
# Subset the data to remove NA values in Age, HoursPerWeek, and TotalHours
cor(subset(sc, !is.na(Age) & !is.na(HoursPerWeek) & !is.na(TotalHours)))
sc_wo_na <- subset(sc, !is.na(Age) & !is.na(HoursPerWeek) & !is.na(TotalHours))

set.seed(20022012)
sc_subset01 <- sc[c(1:4)]
sc_subset02 <- sc[c(2:4, 6:15)]
sc_subset03 <- sc[c(2:4, 12:22)]

sc_samp01 <- sc_subset01[sample(1:length(sc_subset01$LeagueIndex), 500), ]
sc_samp02 <- sc_subset02[sample(1:length(sc_subset01$LeagueIndex), 500), ]
sc_samp03 <- sc_subset03[sample(1:length(sc_subset01$LeagueIndex), 500), ]

ggpairs(sc_subset02,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", shape = I("."))),
        upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I("."))))

ggpairs(sc_subset03,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", shape = I("."))),
        upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I("."))))
```

At first glance, it looks like APM, PAC data, and hot key usage the strongest predictor of league placement as expected. A little surprisingly, age has little correlation to any of the variables. I'm most interested in the relationship between a player's action variables (APM, PAC data, workers made, etc) and league placement.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_plots_cont}
ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), Age), data = sc_wo_na) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), APM), data = sc_wo_na) + 
  geom_boxplot()

by(sc$APM, sc$LeagueIndex, summary)

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), NumberOfPACs), data = sc) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), GapBetweenPACs), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), ActionLatency), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()

by(sc$ActionLatency, sc$LeagueIndex, summary)

ggplot(aes(LeagueIndex, ComplexUnitsMadeTot), data = sc) + 
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") 

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), AssignToHotkeys), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), UniqueHotkeys), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()

by(sc$UniqueHotkeys, sc$LeagueIndex, summary)

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), UniqueHotkeysTot), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(factor(LeagueIndex), WorkersMade), data = sc) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

When comparing league index across many variables, it looks like better players play much faster, and do a little of everything, more. 

Since APM and action latency are the most correlated to league index, I decided to use APM as my basis first. Both are related to activity of a player in general, and it makes sense that the player who does more is better. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, APM_plots}
ggplot(aes(WorkersCreatedTotal, APM), data = sc_wo_na) + 
  geom_point()

ggplot(aes(WorkersCreatedTotal, APM), data = sc) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)

ggplot(aes(WorkersCreatedTotal, APM), data = sc) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 150), breaks = seq(0,150,25))

ggplot(aes(NumberOfPACs, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.006)) 

ggplot(aes(SelectByHotkeys, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)

ggplot(aes(SelectByHotkeys, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.015)) + 
  scale_x_sqrt() + 
  xlab("sqrt(SelectByHotkeys)")

ggplot(aes(AssignToHotkeys, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  xlab("Log10(AssignToHotkeys)")

ggplot(aes(ActionLatency, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/4) + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  xlab("Log10(ActionLatency)")

ggplot(aes(GapBetweenPACs, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) +
  scale_x_log10(limit = c(10,100))  + 
  xlab("Log10(GapBetweenPACs")

ggplot(aes(MinimapAttacks, APM), data = sc) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + 
  scale_x_sqrt() + 
  xlab("MinimapAttacks")
```

When looking at a player's APM, workers created isn't very telling. This isn't surprising because workers created is highly dependent on the game. Workers created compared to APM to certain timestamps would be better measures. The other plots give a little insight into what players are doing with their actions.

# Bivariate Analysis

> **Tip**: As before, summarize what you found in your bivariate explorations
here. Use the questions below to guide your discussion.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

As expected, the better players everything a little more than lower placed players do. The better players utlize more mechanical tools, play much faster, and switch to different parts of the map more. They utilize more hot keys, make more workers to some point, act faster, and possibly most importantly, act around the map more often.

When combing through APM usage, it looks like players with higher APM are constantly clicking around the map to utilize more actions and are constantly using their hot keys. Naturally, the faster they play, the less delay there is between actions. However, they are not right clicking onto the map very much with all that speed. 

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

I was surprised by how little the correlation between hot key assignemnt and hot key usage was when plotted against APM. But I would like to see how action latency, hot key usage, APM, and league placement all go together. I'm surprised at how complex units just drop off at the top tiers and have a spike in the mid tiers.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

The league placement and APM are both strongly negatively correlated to action latency. All the PAC data correlate very well with league placement. It's also no surprise that it correlates with APM naturally directly affects any PAC numbers. 

# Multivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what you found in
the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate plots to investigate
more complex interactions between variables. Make sure that the plots that you
create here are justified by the plots you explored in the previous section. If
you plan on creating any mathematical models, this is the section where you
will do that.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \
strengths and limitations of your model.

Something to improve on - APM patterns through the game because peak APM may be more telling than regular APM through the game if all you do is spam.
